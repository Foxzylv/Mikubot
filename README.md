# How to host bot

So since I can't host this bot 24/7 if you want to use this bot 24/7 then you need to make a discord bot host it and copy the code, to use it like noraml.
You can do that by enabling developer mode on your discord account, and making a bot. Then host the bot on replit, copy the code from this repo. Then copy the Token you got from your bot you made. Now your bot should work, if I didn't explain enough there are many tutorials online on how to set up a discord bot.
