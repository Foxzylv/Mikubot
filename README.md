# How to host bot

So since I can't host this bot 24/7 if you want to use the bot 24/7 then you need to make a discord bot host it and coppy the code to use it like noraml.
You can do that by enabling developer mode on your discord account and making a bot. Then host the bot on replit copy the code and the right Token to get the bot to work and that's it
